PIMaler
=======

Small project derived from `Make 01/2020 <https://github.com/MakeMagazinDE/BrachioGraph>`_ and `https://www.brachiograph.art`_


TODO
-----
 - add links here
 - refer to original BrachioGraph as well
 - add Adafruit or PCM class references
 - sphinx to build docs?!


Sphinx
------

``$ pip install sphinx-rtd-theme``

conf.py needs to look like this

::

import sphinx_rtd_theme

extensions = [
    ...
    "sphinx_rtd_theme",
]

html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"
